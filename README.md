EC483 - Special Topics in Economics of Distribution
===================================================
Repository housing the codebase for calculations related to the Final Project in EC483 (Special Topics in Economics of Distribution), taught by Orhan Torul at Boğaziçi University.

**There are two analysis files. analysis.py is written by Berkay Özgen & analysis.R is written by Kaan Akkaş. We did this to achieve further robustness in our calculations, working completely independent from one another. Our findings support and complement each other.**

You can see all of the relevant calculations we did for the 2022 & 2023 datasets below.
